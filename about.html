<h4> Business Degree </h4>
	<p> I am currently a junior in Business Management. I enjoy management and leadership and
	plan on graduating to manage my own business. The University of Maine has taught me a 
	lot of needed skills in order to run a business from socializing to leadership. </p>

	<h4> Skiing </h4>
	<p> Skiing is a very fun sport that every winter I engage in. I enjoy skiing at Herman
	Mountain, Squaw Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, and Sunday River. Since I was a little
	kid I would be on a pair of skis. </p>
